## Project Overview

This project leverages the sophisticated Phi Data framework along with the potent Llama3.3 LLM, enabling precise data processing and analysis. By integrating tools like DuckDuckGo for efficient web scraping and YFinance for robust financial data retrieval, offers a comprehensive system that dynamically supports the prediction and analysis of stock market behaviors. This blend of technologies ensures a holistic approach to understanding and reacting to financial markets, making it a valuable tool for investors and analysts who require up-to-the-minute information.


### Detailed Description of AI Agents

- **Web Agent**:
  - **Function**: Scours the internet using the DuckDuckGo search tool to gather the latest financial news.
  - **Purpose**: Ensures that our analysis incorporates the most current market dynamics and news, which is crucial for maintaining the relevancy of our insights.

- **Finance Agent**:
  - **Function**: Utilizes YFinanceTools to fetch real-time data on stock prices, analyst recommendations, and other financial metrics directly from Yahoo Finance.
  - **Purpose**: Provides hard, quantitative data necessary for comprehensive market analysis, helping to correlate real-time data with trends identified through news articles.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection**: Both agents work in tandem to automate the tedious process of data collection, ensuring a constant influx of up-to-date information.
- **Data Synchronization**: A robust system synchronizes data from multiple sources, maintaining consistency and integrity across datasets.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Data is not only collected but also analyzed in real-time. This means insights are generated almost instantaneously, providing users with timely information that can influence decision-making.
- **User-Friendly Outputs**: The analysis results are formatted in easy-to-understand reports, making complex financial data accessible to users of all expertise levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Phi Data Framework**: Orchestrates the workflow and interaction between multiple AI agents, ensuring smooth data flow and task management.
- **Llama3.3 LLM**: Analyzes text for deep learning and natural language processing tasks, extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.
- **DuckDuckGo and YFinanceTools**: Essential for real-time web scraping and financial data retrieval, providing the raw data needed for analysis.
- **Python**: The backbone programming language that brings all components together.
- **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis, helping to prepare datasets for analysis and visualization.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a proof of concept that AI can significantly enhance financial analysis by reducing the time needed for data collection and analysis, increasing the accuracy of insights, and allowing for real-time market monitoring. As we move forward, the goal is to further enhance the predictive capabilities of the agents and expand the scope to include more diverse financial indicators and datasets.
